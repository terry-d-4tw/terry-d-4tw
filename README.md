# Hackathon [hack-your-portfolio](https://hack-your-portfolio.devpost.com)

# Action Plan (WIP / Draft)

- [x] Create a `hidden` repo on GitHub that has the same name as the username/ownername with basic README
- [x] Set up some elementary testing via GitHub Actions (e.g. assert 'I love Hackathons and Test Driving' is in README)
- [x] Deploy to GitHub Pages and set up GitHub to auto-deploy on code change
- [x] Set up elementary JAMStack / Jekyll framework
- [ ] experiment with Jekyll themes
- [ ] explore some cool JavaScript to spice up JAMStack if theme does not suffice
- [ ] explore some APIs to connect to JAM Stack
- [ ] OPTIONAL - enhance CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] OPTIONAL - enhance basic testing
- [ ] OPTIONAL - explore OpenTelemetry
- [ ] OPTIONAL - explore Data / Telemetry visualisation - m.b. explore Grafana

# Logs

## Set up some elementary testing via GitHub Actions (e.g. assert 'I love Hackathons and Test Driving' is in README)

```sh
if curl -s -N 'https://github.com/terry-d-4tw/' | grep -q "I love Ruby too"; then
 echo "it worked! ðŸŽ‰"; exit 0; else
 echo "it did not work ðŸ˜”"; exit 1
fi
```

## Set up elementary JAMStack / Jekyll framework
just create a
```yaml
# _config.yml

theme: minima # minima is one of Jekyll's default themes
```


# Judging Criteria

 ## Technology
    How technically impressive was the hack? Was the technical problem the team tackled difficult? Did it use a particularly clever technique or did it use many different components? Did the technology involved make you go "Wow"?
 ## Design
    Did the team put thought into the user experience? How well designed is the interface?
 ## Learning
    Did the team stretch themselves? Did they try to learn something new? What kind of projects have they worked on before?
 ## Adherence to Theme
    Does the hack adhere to the event's theme? Does it implement that theme fully or just partially?
 ## Originality
    Has this project been done before at hackathons in the past? How creative is their project in solving the problem at hand?
 ## Completion
    Does the hack work? Did the team achieve everything they wanted?
